# CS 410 Final Project - Dashbaord Application

This is my final project (a Dashboard Application) for CS410P Web Development.

### Installation and Running It 

1. Run `npm install` to download dependencies. 
2. Run `npm start` to serve the app locally. 


### Technologies and Outside Libraries Used 

- React 
- Ionic Framework and Components 
- Axios
- ChartJS

The documentation for each of these libraries was very helpful, with code samples providing clear ways to use components. 


### Backend 

The back-end for this project is somewhat hidden, as I am thinking of developing it into a proprietary app. 
In addition to this, it has been under development for the past two years (a off-and-on side project), and might require some refactoring 
to get API keys (and other sensitive information) out of program files.
